## Question 1

### (a) Suppose Rs = +1. Consider an equiprobable random policy $\pi$ (i.e., all actions equally likely). Implement policy evaluation algorithm to compute $V \pi$. Report the value function on a grid, similar to the example shown on slide 26 of lecture 10.

```{r}
# Set up the gridworld environment
n_states <- 16  # Total number of states (0 to 15)
grid_size <- 4  # Grid size (4x4)

# Define rewards and terminal states
R <- rep(1, n_states)  # Default reward Rs = 1 for states 1 to 14
R[1] <- -5  # Ry for death state (state 0)
R[16] <- 5  # Rb for target state (state 15)

# Termination flags for terminal states
terminal_states <- c(0, 15)

# Discount factor and initial value function
gamma <- 1
V <- rep(0, n_states)

# Actions (up, down, left, right)
actions <- list(c(0, 1), c(0, -1), c(1, 0), c(-1, 0))

# Function to get the next state based on action
get_next_state <- function(state, action) {
  row <- (state - 1) %/% grid_size + 1
  col <- (state - 1) %% grid_size + 1
  next_row <- row + action[1]
  next_col <- col + action[2]
  
  # Ensure the move stays within bounds
  if (next_row < 1 || next_row > grid_size || next_col < 1 || next_col > grid_size) {
    return(state)  # If the move is out of bounds, stay in the same state
  } else {
    return((next_row - 1) * grid_size + next_col)
  }
}

# policy Evaluation Loop
threshold <- 1e-6  # convergence threshold
delta <- Inf
iteration <- 0

while (delta > threshold) {
  delta <- 0
  V_new <- V
  
  for (state in 1:n_states) {
    if (state %in% terminal_states) {
      next
    }
    
    value_sum <- 0
    for (action in actions) {
      next_state <- get_next_state(state, action)
      value_sum <- value_sum + 0.25 * (R[state] + gamma * V[next_state])
    }
    
    V_new[state] <- value_sum
    delta <- max(delta, abs(V_new[state] - V[state]))
  }
  
  V <- V_new
  iteration <- iteration + 1
}

matrix(V, nrow = grid_size, byrow = TRUE)
```
